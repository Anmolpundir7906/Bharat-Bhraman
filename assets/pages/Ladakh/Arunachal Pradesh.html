For, there is no fanfare, no flashiness, no pomp & show,  Suru Valley doesn’t receive the traveler-love it deserves. Situated in the  Kargil District, Suru is an integral part of Ladakh. Suru is extremely popular in the mountain climbers’ circuits, thanks to the massifs of Nun and Kun. With so much to offer, it is necessary to speak about the beauty of this valley. Suru valley comprises the far west of Ladakh and is situated at an average elevation of 3000 meters. Starting from the major town of  Kargil,  Suru Valley extends it’s up to the Penzi-la glacier, where the Suru river originates.
              The lower  Suru Valley is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Ladakh wither two crops being harvested annually. All this is thanks to the presence of the Suru river and nearby melting glaciers.
