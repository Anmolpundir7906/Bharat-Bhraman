          <h2>Introduction to Meghalaya</h2>
          
         <p>Meghalaya is a very beautiful place to travel and also reflects the rich natural landscapes of eastern India and also one of the most beautiful part of seven sisters of India.
          Meghalaya means the ‘abode of the clouds’ in Sanskrit, and it stands up to its name – rolling clouds, verdant undulating hills, a number of waterfalls and natural springs, all of which make it a personification of natural beauty.
          <br>
          

Meghalaya is an upland area formed by a detached block of the Deccan plateau. Its summits vary in elevation from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,220 to 1,830 metres). The Garo Hills in the west rise abruptly from the Brahmaputra River valley to about 1,000 feet (300 metres) and then merge with the Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills, adjacent highland systems that form a single massif of tablelands separated by a series of eastward-trending ridges. The southern faces of the plateau, overlooking the Bangladesh lowlands, is particularly steep. Many rivers and streams flow out of the plateau, creating deep, narrow, steep-sided valleys; the most important is the Umiam-Barapani, which is the major source of hydroelectric power for Assam and Meghalaya states.
<br>

So let's travel to the beautiful state of Meghalaya.

      <h2>Introduction to PHE PHE FALLS</h2>
      
      <p>Phe Phe falls or Phea Phea falls is the most photographed and most discussed place in the tourist map of Meghalaya in 2019. Located 20 km from Jowai on the way to Karengsuri falls it is a fabulous two-tier waterfall. The first glimpse of Phe Phe fall is capable of taking your breath away. It is one of the tallest waterfalls in Meghalaya. One can also walk to the top of the fall and see the 2nd part of it. Since there is not any proper route to the fall it is good to accompany a guide.
<br><br> Plunging into these waters and refreshing ourselves was a pure delight. With feet immersed in these chilling waters, and eyes closed, the sensation of a sprinkling of water from the Fall touching the skin gave me a strange kind of peace.
<br><br> To stare at the constant motion of the waterfall for minutes, to just be absorbed in the beauty around are moments I live for
