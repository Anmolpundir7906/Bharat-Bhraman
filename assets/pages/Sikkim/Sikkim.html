          <h2>History of Sikkim</h2>
          <p>Under the Namgyal Chogyal dynasty, Sikkim was a Buddhist kingdom from 1642 to 1975. Time and again, the small kingdom of Sikkim had to defend itself against attacks from Nepal. In 1835, Darjeeling, which had previously belonged to Sikkim, was annexed by British India, with Sikkim becoming a protectorate at the same time. The British planted the first tea gardens in Darjeeling with the help of Nepalese workers and turned Darjeeling into an alternative administrative location for British troops stationed in England, with a more pleasant climate than Kolkota. Sikkim regained independence in 1918. With its independence in 1947, India simultaneously took over the protectorate for Sikkim.
            Responsibility for foreign policy and the national army, however, was shifted to India. When the new constitution came into force in 1955, Sikkim’s political influence was severely restricted. In 1973, bureaucrats planned to bring the monarchy to an end. India, for its part, increased its influence, overthrew the 12th Chogyal (king) Palden Thodup Namgyal in 1975 and annexed Sikkim. Sikkim thus became India’s 22nd state. So undoubtedly Sikkim is very beautiful state and one of the most attractive and breathtaking  state of India. So on our next trip we are covering the most beautiful yet offbeat places for you.</p>
