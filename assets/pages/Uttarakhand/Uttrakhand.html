          <h2>History of the Temple</h2>
          
          <p>While there are many legends about this temple, the most popular one dates back to the era when Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati's two sons - Lord Kartik and Lord Ganesha - were asked to circumambulate the universe seven times. Lord Kartik set off on the expedition, undertaking the challenging task of taking seven rounds of the universe, whereas, Lord Ganesha took rounds of his parents, referring to them as his universe. When Lord Kartik returned and learnt of how Lord Ganesha had completed the task and won the appreciation of Lord Shiva, he was enraged. The Puranas say that an angry Lord Kartik left Kailash, his parents' abode, and arrived at Kronch Parvat. Some legends say that after this, Lord Kartik went to a mountain named Srisailam in Southern India, where he was known as Skanda, one of his many names apart from Lord Muruga, Lord Murugan and Lord Subramanya. Others say, Lord Kartik was so furious, he sacrificed his physical self at Kronch Parvat to appease his parents.
